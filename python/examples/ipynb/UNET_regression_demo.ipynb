It's worth noting that to build the training and testing data for the FCNN, you export a single TFRecord file that contains patches of pixel values in each record.  You do NOT need to export each training/testing patch to a different image.

In terms of the shape, the model is trained on 256x256 patches, but can work (in theory) on any patch that's big enough with even dimensions ([reference](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/papers/Long_Fully_Convolutional_Networks_2015_CVPR_paper.pdf)).  Because of tile boundary artifacts, give the model slightly larger patches for prediction, then clip out the middle 256x256 patch.  This is controlled with a kernel buffer, half the size of which will extend beyond the kernel buffer.  For example, specifying a 128x128 kernel will append 64 pixels on each side of the patch, to ensure that the pixels in the output are taken from inputs completely covered by the kernel.
