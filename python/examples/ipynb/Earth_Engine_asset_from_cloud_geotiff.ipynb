This notebook demonstrates how to create Earth Engine assets backed by COGs.  An advantage of COG-backed assets is that the spatial and metadata fields of the image will be indexed at asset creation time, making the image more performant in collections.  (In contrast, an image created through `ee.Image.loadGeoTIFF` and put into a collection will require a read of the GeoTiff for filtering operations on the collection.)  A disadvantage of COG-backed assets is that they may be several times slower than standard assets when used in computations.\n","\n","To create a COG-backed asset, make a `POST` request to the Earth Engine [`CreateAsset` endpoint](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/reference/rest/v1alpha/projects.assets/create).

The URI associated with that entry must have a generation.  See the [object versioning docs](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/object-versioning) for details on generations. If a generation is specified (e.g., `gs://foo/bar#123`), Earth Engine will use it. If a generation is not specified, Earth Engine will use the latest generation of the object. \n","\n","That means that if the object in GCS is updated, Earth Engine will return a \"Failed to load the GeoTIFF at `gs://my-bucket/my-object#123456`\" error because the expected object no longer exists (unless the bucket enables  multiple object versions).
